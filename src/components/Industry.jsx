            These technologies will enable a fourth industrial revolution titled Industry 4.0. Currently, only ten percent of tasks in factories are automated. It is estimated that Industry 4.0 will bring that figure up to 25%. Industry 4.0 relies on the technologies discussed here as well as technologies such as additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing is the use of 3D printers in industrial environments. Technologies such as cyber-physical systems and additive manufacturing will allow manufacturers to produce small batches of products with the same costs and lead times as current mass production setups. Lead time is the amount of time it takes a good to reach the consumer. This development will allow for new markets to emerge for niche products. It will also move manufacturing closer to the end consumer. This will result in new jobs in developed nations such as the United States and Western Europe. These jobs will require skills from fields related to automation such as computer science, operations management, industrial engineering and mechanical engineering.
