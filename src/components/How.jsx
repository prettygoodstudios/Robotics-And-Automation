        The total costs associated with operating a process follows a “U” shape when graphed against the degree of automation. The exact shape of the curve will depend on the specific process. This trend gives us the insight that automating for the sake of automating is a bad idea. Non-value adding tasks or tasks that create bottlenecks are ripe tasks for automation. By automating these tasks significant productivity gains can be made and total costs can be reduced. In addition, automation should be implemented when it provides additional value to the product. Examples of additional value provided by automation could be more consistent and higher quality products. When implemented properly, automation can provide strategic advantages as it can decrease a business’s cost structure and can result in products of superior quality.
